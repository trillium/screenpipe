# E2E Coverage Map

This is a behavioral coverage dashboard for the Tauri/WebDriver E2E suite.
It is not line or branch coverage. A spec contributes coverage to each platform
and layer declared in the manifest, weighted by confidence and criticality.

- Manifest: `e2e/coverage-map.json`
- Specs directory: `e2e/specs`
- Mapped specs: 79
- Declared test blocks: 229
- Weighted coverage points: 178.1

Confidence weights: strong=1.0, partial=0.7, conditional=0.4, smoke=0.3.
Criticality weights: high=1.0, medium=0.7, low=0.4.
Declared test blocks are counted statically from source, so parameterized specs
can execute more runtime cases than this number shows.

## Platform Summary

| Platform | Specs | Declared tests | Weighted points | Layers | Features | Critical score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| windows | 67 | 213 | 172.0 | 15 | 69 | 93% |
| macos | 75 | 193 | 149.3 | 17 | 70 | 90% |
| linux | 58 | 175 | 142.6 | 13 | 65 | 88% |

## Runtime Results

No runtime result directory was supplied. Run with
`--results-dir e2e/results` after WDIO emits runtime JSON to include actual
pass/fail/skip counts.

## Critical Gaps

- windows: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).
- macos: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Audio device health (weak); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).
- linux: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Audio device health (gap); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).

## Execution Integrity

- Specs that claim coverage but contain zero executable test blocks: zzz-browser-state-chat-switch.spec.ts, zz-owned-browser-background-nav.spec.ts, zzz-owned-browser-headless.spec.ts. They assert nothing and no longer count toward any critical feature.
- Declared coverage below is NOT reconciled against execution: no runtime results
  were supplied. Specs can self-skip on hosted runners (no display, vision off,
  recording disabled) and still read as covered. Run `e2e:coverage:runtime` (or pass
  `--results-dir`) in CI to flag declared coverage that did not actually run.

| chat-newchat-fresh.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-drafts | medium | partial | real-user-flow | 2 | The real new-chat shortcut opens a fresh chat from non-empty conversations and reuses one blank chat when pressed repeatedly. |

The autoSend persist precondition is racy in CI — times out with 0 conversations (not the duplicate=2 it guards) ~100% Linux + ~33% macOS. Re-enable once it seeds the persisted conversation deterministically. |
| chat-settings-background-stream.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, settings, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-streaming, settings | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Opening the standalone Settings route mid-stream must not abort the chat: a long synthetic stream keeps running while the user round-trips to Settings, remains live in Recents, and restores the full response (early + final tokens) after the row is clicked. |

Mocks /api/user across all windows and clears set_cloud_token to reproduce the desync deterministically. |
| zz-app-entitlement-gate.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | settings, billing, real-ui-e2e | app-entitlement-gate, billing-gate | high | strong | real-user-flow | 2 | Production billing gate blocks an unentitled session behind the paywall and restores access when the forced-gate flag is cleared. |
| zz-audio-fallback-reverify.spec.ts | macos | auth, entitlement, audio-device, settings | cloud-entitlement-reverify, audio-engine-fallback, settings-recording | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | AuthGuard re-verifies cloud entitlement on window focus so a freshly-subscribed user gets cloud transcription without restart (#4339). |
| zz-enterprise-license-prompt.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | settings, billing, real-ui-e2e | app-entitlement-gate, billing-gate | high | strong | real-user-flow | 2 | Enterprise license prompt handles invalid keys, full-seat errors, and retry success after seats are added without staying stuck in validating state. |
| zz-logout-resurrect.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, settings | account-logout, auth-session | high | strong | synthetic | 1 | Logout must not be resurrected by an in-flight loadUser. Logs in via a synthetic deep-link (?api_key=) with a mocked /api/user fetch, makes the fetch slow, fires it, then clicks logout while it is pending and asserts the slow response cannot re-write the user (the 'logout needs two clicks' bug). Covers the auth-generation guard in use-settings.tsx. |
| zz-owned-browser-background-nav.spec.ts | windows, macos | os-integration, window-lifecycle | owned-browser, window-lifecycle | low | smoke | command | 0 | Owned browser background navigation visibility. |
| zzz-browser-state-chat-switch.spec.ts | windows, macos | real-ui-e2e, storage-privacy | chat, owned-browser | high | strong | synthetic | 0 | Synthetic E2E (zzz- prefix, search-driven): starts from a fresh chat with no conversation file, seeds browser state before the first durable save, then verifies auto-save persists that state and it survives a switch away and back. Keeps native visibility assertions out of this spec because post-zz window state is too brittle; deeper save/merge coverage lives in focused tests. |
| zzz-owned-browser-headless.spec.ts | windows, macos | os-integration, window-lifecycle, local-api | owned-browser, window-lifecycle | high | strong | mixed | 0 | Headless owned browser for background pipes (#4248): with the sidebar never opened, a background eval and navigate-and-scrape over the local API lazily create a hidden offscreen child webview, return a real JS result (6*7 -> 42; document.readyState), and stay invisible; is_ready reflects real serviceability; the same singleton is then adopted into the sidebar panel (page state survives, no second webview). Search-driven and runs last because attaching the child to home tears down home's WebDriver handle. |
